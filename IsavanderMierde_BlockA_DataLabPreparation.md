ELIZA is one of the first chatterbots created by Joseph Weizenbaum

Loebner Prize is awarded each year to the AI bots with the most human-like characteristics, such as the ability to communicate with the judges interactively and intuitively. 

The format of the competition works on a standard Turing Test. In each round, the judges engage in a conversation simultaneously with an AI bot and a human agent through the computer but are not told who is who. It’s the judge’s job to decide based on the responses which one is the bot and which one is human.

The most Loebner Prize wins is 5 and was achieved by Mitsuku and Stephen Worswick (UK) in Swansea, UK, on 15 September 2019. Mitsuku is a chatbot that has won the Loebner Prize in 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Loebner Prize awards the artificial intelligence computer program that is deemed the most humanlike by the judging panel.
